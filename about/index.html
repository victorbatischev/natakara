        <h2>What is PILATES</h2>
        <div class="boxSet">
          <div class="boxLeft375">
           <p>PILATES is the unique  system of body exercises and breathing techniques aiming rejuvenation and health. Pilates was invented in the beginning of the 20th century by Joseph Pilates.<br>

            Born in a family of circus acrobats, ironically Joseph was very unhealthy in the childhood and had some serious illnesses. Young Joseph noticed that certain breathing helped to enhance his body capabilities. Thus, he began to develop breathing techniques combining them with particular physical exercises adapted from his parents. As the result, by the age of 14 he was athletically built and even worked as a model for sports magazines. <br>Later, helping wounded individuals  during the World War I J.Pilates created his recovering system using all improvised means including ordinary bed springs. That is how modern Pilates machines like Cadillac, Reformer and Wunda Chair were originated.

            <p>I&rsquo;m Nataliya Karasawa.<br>
I was born in Germany in 1980 and have lived in many countries since then. At the age of 6, I joined dance classes. Along with dancing, I was getting to know body constitution, fundamentals of human physiology and the joy of studying myself through pleasant movements. I have been perceiving the World through my body.<br>

            I became so passionate about dancing, that I began to teach others on a professional level when I was just 15. My learners’ ages varied from 3 to 60 years old. At that time, I observed a lot of students and their ways of communication with their bodies. It struck my eyes that the majority of dancers treated their bodies so unsafely and carelessly. When the body is loaded to the full extent, sooner or later, some discomfort and even injuries are inevitable. I was not an exception in this matter either. <br>
              As an alternative cure for my backache and knee pain, I discovered the Pilates Method. When I came to a Pilates studio for the first time and lay down on a mat, I felt like I belonged there. From that time, my life has changed significantly and Pilates has become an inalienable side of it.  
I recall my childhood, I remember how effective the exercises taught to me by my grandma were. Of course, my grandma was not any kind of a professional trainer or an athlete. However, she assured me that undertaking the exercises would contribute to my body's health, beauty and longevity. She was absolutely right, as I found out later.<br>     
          
I started to learn Pilates in Tokyo, Japan in Japanese. I took my first course with BASI (Body Arts and Science International) Pilates. While studying Pilates, I gave free lessons to my friends to better understand what I was studying. A little bit later I rented a studio in Roppongi and then Komazawa-Daigaku, Tokyo. I taught Pilates for a low price. Then finally, I opened my own studio in Sangenjaya, after I attended a PIlates Heritage conference in Monchengladbach, Germany. <br>
     At the same time, I took an anatomy course called, ‘Biology For Everybody’ in Tokyo taught by Tatiana Romanova, Ph.D. <br>
Later I attended conferences on the Pilates Method Alliance in both Palm Springs, California in 2017, and Las Vegas, Nevada, USA in 2018. The following year, I practised an autopsy for the first time in my life, at Manoa, University of Hawaii, Aisen Shiatsu School Anatomy.<br>
   I have also attended two conferences in psychology in the Ukraine. In order to better understand human mentality including my own. <br>
  I have studied Pilates in many studios around the world, including London, Barcelona, New York and Hawaii.
<br>
I have been studying the Eric Franklin Methodology for the past year.
<br>
While learning Pilates as an instructor, I was astonished that some of the exercises were identical to those taught to me by grandma a long time ago. That convinced me even more about the effectiveness of Pilates and motivated me to study its Methodology. In our generation Pilates Methodology has become more global. That is why my teaching is focused more diversely as well. At the present time I am teaching in four languages: English, Japanese, Russian, and Ukrainian. My journey in Pilates has been continuing for about 6 years now and I am constantly updating my skills, knowledge and abilities to be the best instructor for you.</p>
